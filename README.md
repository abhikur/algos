# algos
This repo consists of data structure algos like sorting algos, transport algorithms etc.

To test the algos, a spec folder is added which consists of test files for each algo.

To run the tests, follow the following steps:
- clone the repo
- go to the folder `cd algos`
- run `bundle install` to install rspec
- now run `rspec spec/algo_to_test.rb`
